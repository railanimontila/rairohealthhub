<h1>Immunity</h1>
<p>In medicine, the immune system’s way of protecting the body against an infectious disease. The three types of immunity are innate, adaptive, and passive. </p>
<ol>
<li><b><u>Innate immunity</b></u>-includes barriers, such as skin and mucous membranes, that keep harmful substances from entering the body. It is the first response of the body’s immune system to a foreign substance.</li>
<li><b><u>Adaptve immunity</b></u>-Adaptive immunity occurs in response to being infected with or vaccinated against a microorganism. The body makes an immune response, which can prevent future infection with the microorganism. Adaptive immunity can last a person’s entire life.</li>
<li><b><u>Passive immunity</b></u>-Passive immunity occurs when a person receives antibodies to a disease rather than making them through his or her own immune system. Passive immunity provides immediate protection but only lasts a few weeks or months.</li>
