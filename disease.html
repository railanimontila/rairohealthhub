<h1>What are diseases</h1>
<p>A <b>disease</b> is a particular abnormal condition that negatively affects the structure or function of all or part of an organism, and that is not immediately due to any external injury.Diseases are often known to be medical conditions that are associated with specific signs and symptoms.</p>
<p>In humans, disease is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that causes pain, dysfunction, distress, social problems, or death to the person affected, or similar problems for those in contact with the person. In this broader sense, it sometimes includes injuries, disabilities, disorders, syndromes, infections, isolated symptoms, deviant behaviors, and atypical variations of structure and function, while in other contexts and for other purposes these may be considered distinguishable categories. </p>
<h2>Types of Diseases</h2>
<p>There are four main types of disease: Infectious diseases, deficiency diseases, hereditary diseases (including both genetic diseases and non-genetic hereditary diseases), and physiological diseases:</p>
<ol>
<li><u><b>Infectious diseases</u></b>-These are diseases caused by pathgens like bacteria,viruses,and parasites.</li>
<li><u><b>Deficiency  diseases</u></b>-These are diseases caused by the deficiency of a nutrient like vitamins,minerals,and etc.</li>                   
<li><u><b>Hereditary diseases</u></b>-These are diseases caused by the inheritance of genes.Cancer is a possible example.</li>
<li><u><b>Physiological diseases</u></b>-These are diseases that unlike the other three it is about the inner mind of the human and its causes are rather unknown.</li>
</ol>
<h2>what is the difference between disease and disorder</h2>
<p>A disorder is also a collection of signs and symptoms, but it has known associated features that are presumed to be related. </p>
<p>A disease is an involuntary physiological or biological illness that typically has some underlying cause.</p>
